Grammar

Rule 0     S' -> line
Rule 1     line -> fields
Rule 2     line -> fields NEWLINE
Rule 3     fields -> field
Rule 4     fields -> field TAB fields
Rule 5     field -> FIELD

Terminals, with rules where they appear

FIELD                : 5
NEWLINE              : 2
TAB                  : 4
error                : 

Nonterminals, with rules where they appear

field                : 3 4
fields               : 1 2 4
line                 : 0

Parsing method: LALR

state 0

    (0) S' -> . line
    (1) line -> . fields
    (2) line -> . fields NEWLINE
    (3) fields -> . field
    (4) fields -> . field TAB fields
    (5) field -> . FIELD

    FIELD           shift and go to state 4

    line                           shift and go to state 1
    fields                         shift and go to state 2
    field                          shift and go to state 3

state 1
